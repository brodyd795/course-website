### Course Website

This project was created to help manage the Spanish 101 (Elementary Spanish) and Linguistics 120 (Computers and Language) courses that I taught while working as a graduate teaching assistant at Iowa State University.

### Disclaimer

Please note that most of this project was built while I was learning the basics of web development. As such, there are many areas that could be improved on. While this project continues to be hosted on a live site, I am no longer making active contributions to it.

Inside the ```server``` directory live the files that I have living on a remote server for hosting the site. The ```client``` directory holds the front-end React code that I developed on my local machine, ran through the ```build``` process, and copied to the server to be served to the browser. I've now brought all of this together into one repository.
