### Course Website

This project was created to help manage the Spanish 101 (Elementary Spanish) and Linguistics 120 (Computers and Language) courses that I taught while working as a graduate teaching assistant at Iowa State University around 2019-2020. 

While I've taken down the live website, you can view a video walkthrough [here](https://www.loom.com/share/f3693eaea59d409c9f9f6f11b8e62b46). 

### Disclaimer

Note that most of this project was built while I was learning the basics of web development. As such, there are many areas that could have been improved on. 

Inside the ```server``` directory live the files that I had living on a remote server for hosting the site. The ```client``` directory held the front-end React code that I developed on my local machine, ran through the ```build``` process, and copied to the server to be served to the browser. I've now brought all of this together into one repository.
